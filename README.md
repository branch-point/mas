MAS web client
==============

MAS web client is a web application that implements MAS REST API. It is used at [meetandspeak.com][] to provide a web UI.

MeetAndSpeak is a free advanced chat tool for groups.

Installation
------------

Not really possible right now. Only usable with a MAS server which is not yet open sourced.

Currently the purpose of this code is to illustrate how MAS REST API can be implemented. This can be helpful when developing native MAS clients.

Plan
----

Open source MAS server implementation. Create a bundle that is easy to install.
